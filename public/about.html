<p>Hello, my name is Teodora Miteva, and I am an NYU Film and Television student who is also learning how to code. This small and modest project is just the begining :)</p>
<p>Many thanks to my coding professor and mentor-Angela Yu-who made this thing possible. I started with 0 knowledge but she made me believe in myself and my own abilities.</p>
